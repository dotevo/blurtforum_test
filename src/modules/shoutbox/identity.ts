 * all. That's all session.ts's job (minting/verifying the certificate
 * that vouches for a session key in the first place). This file just
 * answers: "is this (scope, author, body, ts, nonce) tuple validly signed
 * by this specific session public key, and is it fresh?" — the same
 * question regardless of whether the session key was ultimately backed by
 * a local Blurt key or a WhaleVault-signed certificate.
 *
 * The message's own `id` doubles as the signature nonce, exactly as
 * before — no separate id-vs-nonce bookkeeping.
