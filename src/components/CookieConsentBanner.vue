/**
 * components/CookieConsentBanner.vue
 *
 * Shown whenever cookie-consent.ts's `consent` is null (no decision made
 * yet this browser) -- see App.vue's `v-if="!cinemaMode && !cookieConsent"`.
 * Purely a thin UI shell around modules/cookie-consent.ts, which owns all
 * the actual state/persistence/GA-loading logic -- see that file's own
 * top-of-file comment for the full story of what this is fixing.
 *
 * Position: self-registers in the shared floating-bottom-layer stack (see
 * modules/floating-stack.ts) as order 20 -- above the player and the
 * blockchain wait-queue bar (order 10, see App.vue), below ShoutboxWidget's
 * chat dock (order 30, topmost -- chat sits above everything else by
 * design), so all three compose predictably instead of each guessing
 * independently. `bottom` is a REAL ResizeObserver measurement of this
 * component's own root element, not a guessed constant -- this banner's
 * own history is two separate bugs from guessed constants (an unbounded
 * one that chased the player's expanded height, then a capped-but-still-
 * guessed 160px) before landing here; measuring the actual rendered height
 * makes that whole class of bug impossible going forward, including for
 * whatever this banner's content ends up being in a future translation
 * or copy change. `visible: () => true` because this component is only
 * ever mounted while it should be showing (v-if in App.vue), same
 * reasoning as ShoutboxWidget's own always-true registration. Cinema mode
 * isn't handled here at all because this component is never shown during
 * it (see the `!cinemaMode` in App.vue's v-if) -- there's no cinema-
 * specific "corner chip" variant for this the way .bc-queue-panel has one,
 * since a cookie-consent decision isn't the kind of thing that needs to
 * interrupt someone mid-video the way a blockchain-sync status does.

     content -- this, not the justify-content miss fixed earlier, was the
     real cause of the banner looking huge on mobile. `flex: 0 1 auto`
