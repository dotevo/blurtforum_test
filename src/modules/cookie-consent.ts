/**
 * modules/cookie-consent.ts
 *
 * Real compliance gap this fixes: index.html used to load Google Analytics
 * (gtag.js, measurement ID G-66P34PGTQF) unconditionally in <head>, on every
 * single page load, before the user had made -- or even been asked to make
 * -- any choice about it. GA sets its own cookies (_ga/_ga_*) purely for
 * tracking, which under EU ePrivacy/GDPR rules needs prior opt-in consent,
 * not just a policy page nobody's forced to read. There was no consent
 * banner and no privacy policy anywhere in the app at all.
 *
 * Fix has three parts:
 *   1. The static gtag <script> tags are gone from index.html. Nothing
 *      Analytics-related loads until loadGoogleAnalytics() below is called.
 *   2. This module tracks the user's choice (localStorage, not a cookie --
 *      remembering "the user already answered the consent question" is
 *      itself strictly necessary storage, which is why it's fine to persist
 *      before any consent decision exists; nothing here is a tracking
 *      cookie).
 *   3. CookieConsentBanner.vue shows on first visit (or whenever consent is
 *      null) and calls acceptCookies()/rejectCookies() below, which is the
 *      ONLY path that ever calls loadGoogleAnalytics(). Rejecting, or just
 *      never answering, means GA plain never loads -- analytics.ts's own
 *      calls already no-op safely when `window.gtag` doesn't exist, so
 *      nothing else needed to change there.
 *
 * There's no real "unload GA mid-session" story once it's been injected
 * (matches how basically every cookie-consent implementation on the web
 * actually works) -- withdrawing consent via resetConsent() takes effect
 * from the NEXT page load, which is what re-showing the banner and pointing
 * this out to the user is for.
